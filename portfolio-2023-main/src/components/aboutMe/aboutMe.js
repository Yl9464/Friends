                I started my coding journey in 2021, since then I've focused on building a diverse skillset.
                My first experience in web development was in a certification program at Framingham State University 
                where my passion and knowledge of coding flurished. After completing the program I furthered my education
                in web developement by gaining a certifcate with Udemy, as well as a Google Professional Certificate in 
                Python IT with Automation.
